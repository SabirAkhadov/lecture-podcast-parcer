lecture-podcast-parcer
======================

Small java crawler that allows to download all podcast videos at once.

With the new(2016) ETH podcasts website we can get all .mp4 links from RSS feed.

E.g. http://www.video.ethz.ch/lectures/d-itet/2016/autumn/263-4640-00L.rss.xml?key=a3f6f7&quality=High

Even though the videos are password protected on the web, no password is needed for this method...


compile:
javac Main.java

run:
java Main
